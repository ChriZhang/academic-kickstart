abstract="We study the rapid stabilization of the heat equation  on the 1-dimensional torus using the backstepping method with a Fredholm transformation. We prove that, under some assumption on the control operator, two scalar controls are necessary and sufficient to get controllability and rapid stabilization. This classical framework allows us to present the backstepping method with Fredholm transformations on Laplace operators in a sharp functional setting, which is the main objective of this work. Finally, we prove that the same Fredholm transformation also leads to the local rapid stability of the viscous Burgers equation. "
