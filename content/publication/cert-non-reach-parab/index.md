abstract="Analysing reachability associated to a control system is a subtle issue, especially for infinitedimensional dynamics, and when controls are subject to bounded constraints. We develop a computer-assisted framework for establishing non-reachability in linear parabolic PDEs governed by strongly elliptic operators, extending recent finite-dimensional techniques introduced in to the PDE setting. The non-reachability of a given target is shown to be equivalent to proving that a properly defined dual functional takes negative values. Our approach combines rigorous numerics with explicit convergence estimates for discretisations of the adjoint equation, ensuring mathematically certified results with tight error bounds. We demonstrate the wide applicability of our framework on Laplacian-driven control systems, showcasing its accuracy and reliability under various types of control constraints."
