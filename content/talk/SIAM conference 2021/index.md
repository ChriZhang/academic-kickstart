abstract = "In this talk, we show how the ideas of backstepping for PDEs can be combined with the notions of system equivalence and pole-shifting to stabilize some controllable systems. This can be thought of as a variant of backstepping for internal distributed controls, which uses a Fredholm-like transformation instead of the 'usual' Volterra transformation of the second kind. This strategy of proof was already used to stabilize the linearized bilinear Schr√∂dinger equation. It can be adapted to stabilize the 1-D linear transport equation. The contrasting spectral properties of these systems lead to very different technical developments. We will focus in particular on the stabilization of a 1-D water tank. It can be shown, using a moments method with some sharp estimates, that the linearized systems around non-uniform steady states are controllable in Sobolev spaces (up to conservation of mass). We use this partial controllability result to construct exponentially stabilizing feedbacks for the linearized water-tank system around non-uniform steady states. This shows that the method can be adapted to more complex hyperbolic systems, despite the additional difficulties due to the coupling terms, and the conservation of mass. "
