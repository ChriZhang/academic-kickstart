# Welcome!

I defended my PhD thesis at the [Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr), under the supervision of [Jean-Michel Coron](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/coron/), in October 2019. I am interested in the control and stabilization of PDEs, more specifically problems of internal control and stabilization for hyperbolic systems.
