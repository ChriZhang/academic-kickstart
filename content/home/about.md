# Welcome!
I am a postdoctoral researcher for the [Chair in Applied Analysis](https://caa-avh.nat.fau.eu/) at the [Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen Nürnberg](https://www.fau.de/), working with [Enrique Zuazua](https://verso.mat.uam.es/web/ezuazua/zuazua.html).

I am interested in the control, stabilization and optimal control of PDEs and systems, mainly hyperbolic and parabolic equations, with or without constraints. More recently, I have taken an interest in data-driven modelling and control, in particular methods involving the Koopman operator.

I defended my PhD thesis (you can find a version of the manuscript [here](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02464011v1)) at the [Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr), under the supervision of [Jean-Michel Coron](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/coron/), in October 2019.
