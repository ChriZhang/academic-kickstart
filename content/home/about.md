# Welcome!

I am currently a PhD candidate at the Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions, under the supervision of [Jean-Michel Coron](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/coron/). I am interested in the control and stabilization of PDEs, more specifically problems of internal control and stabilization for hyperbolic systems.
