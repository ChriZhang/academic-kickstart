# Welcome!
I am currently in secondment at [INRIA - Nancy Grand Est](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-nancy-grand-est), as a researcher in the [SPHINX team](https://www.inria.fr/fr/sphinx). 
I am interested in the control, stabilization and optimal control of PDEs and systems, mainly hyperbolic and parabolic equations, with or without constraints. I have also worked on problems in data-driven modelling and control, in particular methods involving the Koopman operator. More recently, I have taken an interest in reachability analysis. With PhD student Ivan Hasenohr and his advisors [Camille Pouchol](https://poucholcamille.wixsite.com/perso) and [Yannick Privat](https://yannick-privat.perso.math.cnrs.fr/), we are developing computer-assisted proofs of reachability and non-reachability.

I was formerly a postdoctoral researcher for the [Chair Dynamics, Control and Numerics](https://dcn.nat.fau.eu/) at the [Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen Nürnberg](https://www.fau.de/).
I defended my PhD thesis (you can find a version of the manuscript [here](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02464011v1)) at the [Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr), under the supervision of [Jean-Michel Coron](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/coron/), in October 2019.
